# Frontend Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the frontend project! As a backend engineer, follow these steps to get started with the frontend code on your system:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js**: You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies and run the project. You can download them from here.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   - Clone the frontend repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
   - Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your frontend repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned frontend directory:
     ```
     cd frontend-project
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Run the following command to install all project dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. **Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory (if not already present).
   - Set any environment-specific variables required for the frontend (e.g., API endpoints, authentication tokens).

5. **Start the Development Server**:

   - To start the project in development mode, run:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - This will launch the development server, and you can access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Build for Production**:
   - When you're ready to deploy, build the production-ready bundle using:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - The optimized files will be generated in the `build` directory.
